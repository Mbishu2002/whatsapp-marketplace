/**
 * Generate a system prompt for extracting product listings from messages

Your current task is to extract product listing information from a WhatsApp message.
Analyze the message and extract the following fields:
- title: The name or title of the product

- currency: The currency (default to FCFA if not specified)
- location: Where the product is located or can be picked up
- category: The product category (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, Furniture)
- condition: The condition of the product (e.g., New, Used, Like New)

Return the extracted information as structured data. If you cannot determine a field with confidence, leave it as null.
Do not make up information that is not present or implied in the message.`;

/**
 * Generate a system prompt for handling search queries
 * @returns {string} The search handling system prompt
 */
function getSearchHandlingPrompt() {
  return `${getBaseSystemPrompt()}

- category: Product category filter
- location: Location filter
- minPrice: Minimum price filter
- maxPrice: Maximum price filter
- exactPrice: Exact price filter

/**
 * Generate a system prompt for handling group registration
 * @returns {string} The group registration system prompt
 */
function getGroupRegistrationPrompt() {
  return `${getBaseSystemPrompt()}

Your current task is to guide a user through registering their WhatsApp group for marketplace monitoring.

The registration process has two main steps:
1. Collecting group information via this chat
2. Directing the user to scan a QR code on our website to link their WhatsApp account

First, collect the following information:
- Group name: The name of the WhatsApp group
- Invite link: The WhatsApp group invite link (format: https://chat.whatsapp.com/ABCDEF123456)

After collecting this information, explain that they need to complete one more step:
- Visit our website to scan a QR code (similar to WhatsApp Web)
- This links their WhatsApp account to our system for monitoring
- This step is necessary due to WhatsApp platform limitations

Be friendly and helpful. Explain the benefits of registering their group:
1. Automatic product listing extraction from group messages
2. Products become searchable in the marketplace
3. Increased visibility for sellers
4. Better organization of marketplace items

If the user seems confused, guide them step by step through the registration process.
If they want to cancel at any point, respect their decision and offer other assistance.`;
